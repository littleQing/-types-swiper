This is a stub types definition for @types/swiper (https://swiperjs.com).

swiper provides its own type definitions, so you don't need @types/swiper installed!

``` bash
npm i --save-dev @types/swiper  https://github.com/littleQing/types-swiper
```
or

package.json

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@types/swiper": "https://github.com/littleQing/types-swiper"
}
```
